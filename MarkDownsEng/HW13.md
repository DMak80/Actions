## Memory

### Theory
 1. [Andrey Akinshin — Let's talk about memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGtieBVI1lk)
 2.  [Getting started with dotMemory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tmcx6cTExg)
 3. [dotMemory Unit - .NET memory usage monitoring with unit tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGwdb5FXuNk)
 4. *Addition:* [.NET GC Internals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUkQYy-K8Y-wYcDgDXKhfs6OT8fFQtVm)

### Practice
Task in pairs 
1. Profile by runtime (using Benchmark .NET) and by memory ([setting Benchmark .NET](https://adamsitnik.com/the-new-Memory-Diagnoser/)): ordinary, virtual, static, generic methods, dynamic, reflection. Which is faster, by how much? Attach screenshots of measurements.
2. Replace the cache implementation. Use RAM instead of DB.
3. Try using Theory to create 10 million rows with different calculations (if it doesn't work with Theory, see below). Run, profile in dotMemory Unit, monitor memory consumption. We put an Assert on memory consumption in accordance with the amount of data that you will calculate yourself based on the length of the rows). **If Theory or xUnit are not compatible with dotMemory Unit, then implement the tests as it turns out.**
