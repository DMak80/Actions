# Homework №11

## Dynamic

### Theory
1.  [Карлен Симонян — Эффективное использование DLR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lltDIUQrjgY)
2.  [Multiple dispatch в C#](https://habr.com/ru/post/283522/)

### Questions
1.  What is a CallSite?
2.  What does dynamic d = 100 unfold into when compiling?
3.  What is an “adaptive cache”, how is it implemented?
4.  What is the "multiple dispatch” technique? How you can implement multiple dispatch in C# based on dynamic?

### Practice
1.  Rewrite ExpressionVisitor from past homework using the multiple dispatch technique. It is forbidden to inherit the base ExpressionVisitor from the standard library
2.  Add error handling based on multiple dispatch. Handle at least 3 different types of errors in different ways
3.  Embed ILogger in dependencies, log errors in the base class ExceptionHandler
