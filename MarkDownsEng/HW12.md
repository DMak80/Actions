## Practice
1.  Write benchmarks for all calculator methods. Compare the effectiveness of implementation based on ASP.NET Controllers and Giraffe. Attach a screenshot of the results to the task in YT. The artificial delay of 1000 needs to be removed
2.  Connect to the web application [Mini Profiler](https://miniprofiler.com )
3.  In the comments to the task, write what conclusion you came to regarding the comparison of the performance of the F# version and the C# version
